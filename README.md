# Technical Test for Clarksons Platou

## Access
To open the project launch the html files for each of the sections.

For section one, the results are all printed to the console.
There is also a version of the js file for section one that uses NodeJS to read tree.json and write the results of the script to other json files. This can be run however you like.
I have also edited tree.json by removing all of data that I didn't need. This was done for the sake of readability when viewing the results. 

## Summary
Section one mostly presented a challenge due to my minimal experience using javascript. The logic, however, was mostly straightforward. I did have trouble with the descriptions of the tasks as it seems the parentID of a node didn't match it's parent's id but I figured out a way to get a result using another method.

Sections two and three are very minimalistic in their design but meet the requirements described.

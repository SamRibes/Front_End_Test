# Technical Test for Clarksons Platou

## Tasks
The tasks as I understood them were to:
  - Flatten a tree structure into a single collection
  - Return the parent of a node given that node's ID
  - Add a new node into the children of a node at a user-determined index.
  
  - Take a message with tags attached and apply different stylings to each tag based on what prefix it had
  - Take those tags, remove the prefix and display the text attached
  
  - Create a DOM structure that dynamically changes layout based on the size of the window
  
## Progress
I managed to complete all of the tasks given

## How to run the code
To open the project launch the html files for each of the sections.

For section one, the results are all printed to the console.
There is also a version of the js file for section one that uses NodeJS to read tree.json and write the results of the script to other json files. This can be run however you like.
I have also edited tree.json by removing all of the data that I didn't need. This was done for the sake of readability when viewing the results. 

## Future work
To carry on with this I would:
  - Implement json reading and writing using vanilla javascript
  - Improve the aesthetic of the html pages
  
## Struggles
Section one mostly presented a challenge due to my minimal experience using javascript and so I had to learn how certain things worked (e.g. weak typing). The logic, however, was mostly straightforward. I did have trouble with the descriptions of the tasks as it seems the parentID of a node didn't match it's parent's id but I figured out a way to get a result using another method.

Sections two and three are very minimalistic in their design but meet the requirements as I understood them.
